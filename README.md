## What is Rutgers Course Tracker?
In short, Rutgers Course Tracker (RCT) allows users to view courses and subscribe to their openings. Inspired by Abe Stanway's [Schedule Sniper](http://abe.is/a/sniper/) and Vaibhav Verma's python [Sniper](https://github.com/v/sniper). 

Additionally, users can view information about current and upcoming semesters. This includes prerequisites, course specific information and even professor ratings and details.
Once a section of course is tagged to be tracked, the app checks for openings at user selectable interval.

## Motivations?
I started this project on January 14th 2015 out of desperation. Other "course sniping" solutions out there are focused on the New Brunswick campus, leaving me with very few options. In a few days I threw together something simple and it worked quite well. I began work on a full version and within a few weeks it was stable and presentable enough to be my first app on the Google Play Store.

## How was it made?
RCT was developed in my spare time using <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij 14.04</a>. It was designed to take advantage of the <strong>Model-View-Presenter (MVP)</strong> architectural pattern which enabled me to create a robust, extensible and testable code base.

I owe the speed at which I developed the application to <a href="https://github.com/tevjef/Rutgers-Course-Tracker/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L87-L146">many open source libraries</a>. Each one of them likely saved me from 3 days of headaches, debugging and testing. 3 of them in particular, <strong>RxJava</strong>, <strong>Retrofit</strong>Â and <strong>Dagger</strong>, greatly simplified my business code and reduced some very complex logic to child's play. I highly recommend using any of these libraries in you own applications.
