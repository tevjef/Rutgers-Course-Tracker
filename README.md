======================
An application to view courses and subscribe to their openings. An idea born out of severe procrastination. Inspired by Abe Stanway's [Schedule Sniper](http://abe.is/a/sniper/) and Vaibhav Verma's python [Sniper](https://github.com/v/sniper).

Why/how was it made?
----------------
I started on January 14th 2015, the day I decided to register for classes, 6 days before the spring semester began. 

It was made using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) with an emphasis on design and utilizing the new APIs in Android Lollipop.
